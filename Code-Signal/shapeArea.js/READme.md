# shapeArea

Below we will define an `n`-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given `n`.
A `1`-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length `1`. An `n`-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the `n - 1`-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the `1`-, `2`-, `3`- and `4`-interesting polygons in the picture below.

## Example

* For `inputArray = [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3]`, the output should be
`adjacentElementsProduct(inputArray) = 21`.
`7` and `3` produce the largest product.
* For `n = 2`, the output should be
`shapeArea(n) = 5`;
* For` n = 3`, the output should be
`shapeArea(n) = 13`.

## Input/Output

* [execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

* **[input] integer n**
__Guaranteed constraints:__
`1 â‰¤ n < 104`.

  An array of integers containing at least two elements.

* **[output] boolean**

  The area of the n-interesting polygon.
